QUESTION D

** Comparing the Facebook-Ego Network with other random networks
The facebook-ego network which is a real-world network has its degree distribution approximately modelled by a power law distribution. This makes sense because in real-world networks, most nodes have low degrees and just few outlier nodes have high degrees.
Looking at the degree distributions of the random networks, we can observe the following;
- Graphs generated using Watts-Strogatz model have a a degree distribution that is almost a normal distribution.
- The graphs generated with scale-free and Barabasi-Albert model have a degree distribution following a power law distribution.

The Barabasi-Albert model best approximates the Facebook-ego network. It's degree distribution follows the power law distribution and the distribution of the clustering coefficient follows the normal distribution just like that of the Facebook-Ego network.



** Comparing the Twitter-Ego Network with other random networks
Looking at the Twitter-Ego network, we can see the degree distribution is negatively skewed. None of the random networks we have constructed approximates such a degree distribution.
